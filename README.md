This project builds a real estate price prediction website using machine learning techniques using various features like home square ft area, bedrooms, location, etc. 
It includes building a model using sklearn and linear regression with a Bangalore home prices dataset, creating a Python Flask server to serve HTTP requests, and developing a front-end interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Model Building Steps:
1. Data Loading and Cleaning
2. Outlier Detection and Removal
3. Feature Engineering
4. Dimensionality Reduction
5. Model Building using Linear Regression
6. Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV
7. Model Evaluation with K-Fold Cross-Validation
8. Model Saving

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Sklearn for model building
- Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as IDEs
- Python Flask for HTTP server
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for UI
